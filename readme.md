### By the repository owner

#### Big Rat

> I first saw it in a screenshot of a 4chan post, and the person who took the screenshot posted the big rat image. That is the one on the website right now.  
I have tried to find the source of the image through TinEye and Google Image Search, but all of them turned out to be from posts that doesn't look like they're the original.  
If you are the owner of the big rat image please [contact me][email-copyright].
